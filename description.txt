Grants you Vanilla & Calamity potion buffs in a way that doesn't use buffslots.

To use craft a 'PotPot' with bottled water at a workbench and rightclick to open a UI.
Place potions inside and close the UI to apply buffs.
Campfires / Heart Lanterns / etc. also work.
You don't need to keep it inventory, it's only used to set your current Potions.
Currently has 49 Slots.

If you load into a World and have items from anothermod inside a PotPot which is no longer enabled these items will be deleted.
Internal Cooldowns like in the Draconic Elixir also work correctly.
Potion Interactions between Vanilla and Calamity are also included, like ProfaneRage Potion disabling Vanilla Rage or Well Fed being buffed by a Lore item.

A Calamity Update will break the interop if Buff or Item ID's are changed.
