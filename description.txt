Grants you Vanilla & Calamity potion buffs in a way that does'nt use buffslots.

To use craft a 'PotPot' with a watercandle at a workbench and rightclick to open a UI.
Place potions inside and close the UI to apply buffs.
Campfires / Heart Lanterns / etc. also work.

Currently Calamity support is strong and static , meaning a Calamity update might break this mod and it requires Calamity to run.
